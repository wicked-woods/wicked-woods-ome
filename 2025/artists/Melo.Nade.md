The name Melo.Nade stems from the fluid flow of the vibe. With a diverse musical palette and almost 20 years of experience behind decks, Melo.Nade has a refined ability to move crowds at any time of day. Balancing the dark and the light, you can expect to hear sounds from deep dubstep to lustful world beats, breaks/garage, grime/hip-hop/trip-hop/soul/R&B, and thought-provoking bass music. Melo.Nade’s recent festival appearances since 2023 include Envision, Shambhala, Wicked Woods, and Deep Roots.

Beyond beats, Melo.Nade's music holds purpose. A life-altering traumatic brain injury in 2018 shaped his artistic trajectory, leading him to embrace a shift in perspective and boundaries for self-care. Music is a conduit for emotional release, empowering listeners to work through inner tensions to find a cathartic release.

As a classically trained pianist driven by a passion for sonic exploration, Melo.Nade brings a unique perspective to his music productions that blend classical and cultural sounds with trip hop, dubstep, and bass music. Music production has been essential in Melo.Nade’s healing journey and he aspires to produce music that invokes healing for his listeners.

Whether it's a one hour festival set that turns into a 3+ hour happenstance, Melo.Nade is prepared to keep the dance going with heavy chill vibrations.
