The path to paradise starts in hell.

GRIIMM is the bass music project of producer, DJ, and touring guitarist Thomas Vittas. Hailing from Toronto, Canada, GRIIMM delivers a digitally corrosive sound that fuses energy with emotion, built on a foundation of shimmering synths, sub-bass, and euphoric melodies. Drawing on his experience recording and touring with JUNO-nominated alternative act ThxSoMch, Vittas masterfully blends electronic and analog elements to create a sound that is as heavy as it is emotive.

GRIIMM’s work includes collaborations with renowned artists like ATLiens and viral edits of classic rock and grunge tracks, which have become crowd favorites at shows and gained online traction on platforms like SoundCloud and TikTok. His ability to reimagine familiar sounds has earned him a growing fanbase and a distinct voice in the bass music scene.

Onstage, GRIIMM is known for his electrifying performances and eclectic range, earning him a reputation as one of Toronto’s most exciting DJs. He has supported major acts such as SVDDEN DEATH, Blanke, Dion Timmer, and Deathpact, captivating audiences with high-energy sets that leave a lasting impression.
