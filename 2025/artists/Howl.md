Howl lurks in silence, dwelling in darkness. As the moon rises, attuned to the shifting subtleties of the shadows, her ritual begins. Like the rise and fall of the tides she will pull you into the depth and gravity of sound, initiating you on a journey beneath the stars. Howl is a sound system Sorceress, alchemizing lush ambient soundscapes, hauntingly beautiful vocals, and expansive synth swells with a variety of bone rattling bass music. Drawing inspiration from dreamy dnb, future garage and wave, down to the darker depths of hard hitting grime and dubstep, she conjures sets anywhere from 50 - 175 bpm. You can also find her with Misfortune Cat as their deadly duo, PuppyCat.
