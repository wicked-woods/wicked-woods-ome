Miirror is deeply rooted in the West Coast festival community — not just as a DJ, but as a builder of spaces and sound. They run Nocturne Sound System, push immersive visuals through MIIRROR Visuals, and have worked behind the scenes and on stage at countless festivals across BC.

Miirror’s sets focus on dialed-in frequencies and flow — shaped by years of running sound, hosting events, and staying close to the dancefloor.
