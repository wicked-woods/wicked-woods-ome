Born and raised in Kimberley, BC, ColtCuts has carved a path through the North American bass music scene with his signature blend of deep dubstep, halftime, and raw, distorted low-end power.

He’s played massive stages like Shambhala’s AMP & Pagoda, Deep Dark & Dangerous takeovers all over the world and is on the bill for a massive takeover in Denver at Mission Ballroom. With releases on Deep Dark & Dangerous, Duploc, SubCarbon, and Dank ‘N’ Dirty Dubz, ColtCuts is certainly one to watch!
