Over 25 years ago, J9 began her musical journey in Calgary’s rave scene, eventually launching J9Productions in 2011. She started out producing burlesque and live music events but shifted her focus to House music in 2016, introducing the city to the beloved HUMPDay HOUSE Party.

In 2022, J9 stepped behind the decks herself, quickly gaining recognition with performances at events like Wicked Woods Music Festival and opening slots for artists such as Megan Hamilton, Father Funk, &  Average Citizens.

Known for her sensual, groove-filled sets, J9’s preferred sound blends House and Drum & Bass—but she loves playing anything that makes her feel good. From indie dance to downtempo and organic textures, she creates a vibe that ignites the dance floor and ensures an unforgettable experience.

J9 aims to evoke deep emotion, spread love and positivity, and bring people together—one frequency at a time.
