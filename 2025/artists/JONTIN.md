JONTIN - newfie noun \ Jonathon \ Origin: Newfoundland pronunciation JON-TIN 
If you've seen him play before... then you know what’s up! This guy’s ability to read the 
floor, create the mood and resonate his good vibe & high energy presence… it’s the Jontin 
effect!!! 

From the western Canada electronic music scene to the LGBTQ community, he's been 
making waves and there's no signs of slowing down! This East Coast import moved to 
Edmonton in 2006 and immediately joined the local electronic music scene. Jonny’s easy 
going, fun-loving and animated personality made him a very popular regular at local clubs 
and most events. You knew Jonny was there because his high-energy spirit of 
inclusiveness and humour charged up everyone around him. It didn't take long for Jonny's 
love of the culture and passion for music before he found himself playing with CDJs. It was 
obvious the boy had some skills, expressing that same dynamic personality in his stage 
presence and track selection cocktail of G-House, Tech-House, Bassline, Minimal Tech & of 
course the remixed tracks that bring you back. 
So, if you see JONTIN booked for a show near you, don’t miss your chance to experience 
the East-Coast DJ grown from a love of dance culture, a dance floor aficionado… GO!!!
