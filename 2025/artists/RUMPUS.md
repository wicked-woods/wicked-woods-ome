Award-winning DJ and producer, RUMPUS, brings his unique style house music to the stage, incorporating live drumming into his electrifying performances, which have earned him the moniker RUMPUS—meaning “a noisy disturbance; a commotion.”

With multiple Beatport-charting tracks, he has released music on influential labels like Insomniac, Club Sweat, Space Yacht, DND, Hood Politics, and Westwood Recordings. His music has been featured on Spotify’s top dance music playlists and in the last year, his tracks have been supported by notable artists including John Summit, Tiesto, Solomun, Dom Dolla, Marten Hørger, Kaskade, Nora En Pure, and more. In 2025 is track SET IT OFF was featured in season 3 of HBO's hit series 'The White Lotus'. He has performed at some of the world’s best music festivals including Shambhala, Burning Man, Envision, Bass Coast, and Lightning in a Bottle.

His hit single “Feel the Beat” has racked up over 5 million Spotify streams, and his viral edit of RÜFÜS DU SOL’s “Innerbloom” dominated the Hypeddit progressive house charts, holding the #1 spot for five consecutive months. With a recent guest mix on Diplo’s Revolution and a stacked library of unreleased music, it’s no secret that the past year has been a breakout moment for this artist and why he’s turning the heads of the biggest tastemakers in the industry.
