Allie Bruni, E-RYT750 / Āyurvedic wellness, and electronic DJ, began practicing yoga in the late 70’s and considers herself a lifelong student. Anjali has taught classical Ashtanga Yoga (eight-limbed path) Internationally to hundreds of students in teacher trainings, workshops, classes and events. Allie's instruction is inspired by the authentic and traditional yoga teachings of Hatha yoga and weaves devotional intention, healthy alignment principles, Āyurveda and subtle body awareness into pranayama, meditation and asana. Anjali embraces the theory of “teaching to learn” and continues to study and deepen her understanding of yoga theory and philosophy with emphasis on the Yoga Sutras, Bhagavad Gita, Sanskrit and Sacred Sound.
