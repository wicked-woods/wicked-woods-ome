Dirty-D  / Genre Bender 

With over 20 years behind the decks, Dirty-D is a true veteran of the Canadian electronic music scene. Hailing from the mountain town of Kimberley, BC, she launched her DJ journey with a deep love for crate-digging and eclectic sounds, steadily carving out a name for herself with dynamic, genre-defying sets.

Dirty-D isn't bound by style—she plays good music, period. Whether it’s funk, breaks, house, bass, or hip-hop, her selections are deep, dynamic, and always dancefloor-focused. Her ability to read the crowd and keep bodies moving has earned her sets alongside heavyweights like DJ Czech, Krafty Kuts, The Funk Hunters, Smalltown DJs, and Scratch Bastid—to name just a few.

Beyond the booth, Dirty-D has played a key role in shaping the West Kootenay music scene as a co-creator of Wicked Woods Music Festival—a grassroots gathering that’s become a staple for lovers of fresh beats, good vibes, and forest-fueled dancefloors.

From late-night forest stages to main-stage madness, Dirty-D brings decades of passion, precision, and pure vibe to every set.
