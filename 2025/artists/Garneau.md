Known for doing the most with the least, Garneau draws inspiration from a wide range of dance music styles, including house, techno, electro and UK bass.
Aside from being a DJ\Producer, Garneau is also the founder of Club Designs, a niche electro inspired record label. His label’s diverse roster has quickly gained international recognition for its many releases, including support from artists like Josh Wink, Laurent Garnier, DJ Stingray, and more.
Over the years, Garneau has released music on a wide array of respected labels, including Magic City, Chapter 3, Posse Up, and Philthtrax, including various collaborations with Chicago Ghetto House originators Dj Slugo, Parris Mitchell, and the late Dj Deeon.
Now a cornerstone of the western Canadian underground scene, Garneau is a regular fixture at Bass Coast Festival, resulting in frequent collaborations with Max Ulis, one of two Bass Coast curators. Garneau also collaborates with Vancouver based Destrata as part of their high-energy side project Energy Boyz, a duo that merges Destrata’s bass-driven sounds with Garneau’s signature stripped-back party tracks. 
Garneau’s reach extends beyond the festival circuit, with notable performances on platforms like Boiler Room and Subtle.fm, to name a few. 
Through his music, his label, and his collaborations, Garneau remains one of the most exciting and versatile figures in the underground music scene.
