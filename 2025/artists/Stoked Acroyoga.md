Felicia rooted in Winnipeg for her first 20 years and spent the following ten travelling all of North America to become an expert on all things movement! She loves to flow by practicing partner acro dance, rockabilly jive, rock climbing, slackline, and above all - acroyoga! Felicia acquired her Acroyoga Teacher Training certificate from Acroyoga Calgary in 2023, and has been teaching weekly acro workshops ever since! She travels regularly across North America to acro festivals to bring you the latest inspiration from the acrobatics, yoga, cheer, and acro-dance communities. Felicia’s Grandpa said it best, “I always know that Felicia is okay because I check her Facebook photos and see that she’s still standing – on her hands!”
