Join Jamie & Kenzie, for a playful and empowering AcroYoga workshop! 

Jamie is a seasoned Pilates and AcroYoga instructor with over 15 years of teaching experience. Certified through the Physical Mind Institute and trained with AcroYoga Calgary, Jamie has been practicing AcroYoga since 2017 and brings a deep love for movement, connection, and community to every class.

As the co-founder of Stoked Acroyoga in Revelstoke, BC, Jamie has cultivated a vibrant local scene through weekly classes and the beloved Wednesday Wobbles jam—an open space for slackline, yoga, and acro play. Jamie’s workshops are rooted in trust, communication, and joy, lifting people up both physically and emotionally.

Kenzie has a background in recreational gymnastics and competitive rock climbing. Besides partner acrobatics, these days they enjoy learning parkour and dance, trail running and of course going to the gym. Kenzie has been a tree planter for 7 years and is currently studying massage therapy. Movement is the common thread weaving its way through their life.

Whether you're new to AcroYoga or looking to refine your skills, come experience the magic of movement, laughter, and shared balance. Stoked Acroyoga has brought their energy to festivals like Kaslo Jazz Fest, Calgary AcroYoga Festival, and Kootenay Yoga Festival—and now it’s your turn to fly!
