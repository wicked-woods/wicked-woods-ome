Weird Art Projects is a multidisciplinary arts collective, driven to create thought-provoking, memorable, and playful works of public art.

Weird Art Projects was formed in 2020, when Unknown Artist and Dream Weaver Arts began combining digital and instrumental musical performances with live digital and physical media art.  

Through 2020 and 2021 Weird Art Projects explored a mostly Synthwave art style, before extending into surrealism for the “Play with Your food” Project; a three piece interactive food themed installation built for burning man 2022. The project brought on Neitz to the aesthetic and logistics team, and JTree was added as a ticketed Welder- creating a four crew member dream team. While the “Play with Your Food” project ended in 2022, the Weird Art Projects crew has continued to create weird art projects together utilizing many different media types throughout Western Canada.

This year we continue our mission, to explore the boundaries of perception with OmegaMelon. The first juicy slice of a proposed series of large-scale interactive installations
