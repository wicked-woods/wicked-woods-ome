SwaggaCats has been making a name for himself in the Calgary music scene for quite a few years now, joining the Sub Chakra roster in 2021. Not only is he a talented DJ, VJ, and producer, but he has also led various projects such as The Yellow Dubmarine, Dumpster Fire Records, and Quiet Hours Silent Disco.

His agile, cat like reflexes allow him to move between genres flawlessly. You may catch him playing an acid infused techno set one weekend, flexing a bass music set the next, and projection mapping the walls at the afters. Known for his lively performance style, if you're not dancing, It's guaranteed that he will be.

This is not your average house cat.
