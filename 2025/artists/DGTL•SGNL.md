DGTL•SGNL is an aspiring experimental bass producer making waves in the bass scene. By taking old school hip-hop break beats and adding his own mind melting flair, DGTL•SGNL is able to teleport the listener to a distant world where society is far more advanced and being cybernetic is the norm.

After discovering dubstep at a young age, DGTL•SGNL went to his first underground rave at 16. Since then, he has had an instant connection with the bass music community, pushing him to pursue music full time. His early inspirations are drawn from his adventures at Bass Coast and Shambhala Music Festival, and have morphed his production into the cataclysmic, avante-garde sound it is today.

Within a short time, DGTL•SGNL has gained support from labels such as Wavecraft Collective, Intrinzic Music, Saturate , Wormhole Music Group, and Misc Label. He has also performed alongside Pigeon Hole, Khiva, Um.., Abstract Sonance, and Tripzy Leary.

His goal for his project is to create a digital signal through sound!
