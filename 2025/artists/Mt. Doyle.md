Back in the day, Mt. Doyle was known for his smooth taste in Drum & Bass and his unmatched love for pizza. But it wasn't long before Doyle expanded his horizons to include Funk, House, Hip-Hop and Bass, all with his soulful West Coast flavour. He quickly became a staple in the BC electronic music scene, known not only for his multi-genre sets but his range of recorded mixes as well.

Over the past 10 years, Mt. Doyle has played lounges, clubs and festivals all over the North West, including Shambhala, Lightning In A Bottle, Rifflandia, Electric Love, Wicked Woods, Friendzy Fest, Fozzy Fest, Bamboo Bass, Astral Harvest, Ska Fest, Sun Fest and The Tall Tree Festival. In that time heâ€™s shared the stage with international heavyweights Aphrodite, Camo & Krooked, Ed Solo, A.Skillz, Stickybuds, The Funk Hunters, Chali 2na, JFB, Dub FX, Rusko, Technimatic, LSB & DRS, Serial Killaz, Dub Pistols, Ray Keith, Netsky and Andy C.

In 2016 Mt. Doyle started The Hydration Mix Series, a monthly Liquid Drum & Bass podcast with DJs Akela, Willisist, Erski, Reflektor, Lasu and DJ Surgeon. Later that year Doyle took on a whole new style as he joined the ranks of Victoria based Hip-Hop band Illvis Freshly, where he made his singing debut. Now, when he's not solo, you can catch his live set with Doyle on vocals and Philly on the guitar.

Over the years Mt. Doyle has established himself as one of the most versatile DJs on Vancouver Island. With a mountainous lust for music and style that keeps you guessing, Mt. Doyle will keep bodies moving any time, any place, with whatever the hell he wants.
