TRIOS, a Vancouver-based DJ and producer, fuses the raw pulse of Trap and Dubstep with a soul shaped by Hip-Hop and House. From 2009-2014, he electrified West Coast dancefloors and remixed legends like Peter Hook (Joy Division), sharing stages with Steve Lawler and Art Department.

 In 2016, Bass music reignited his roots, pulling him back to the Hip-Hop that defined his youth. After a five-year hiatus, TRIOS roared back in 2019, headlining Altitude Music Festival and opening for heavyweights like UZ, TVBOO, BUKU, and Dimond Saints. 

His 2024 Surrender EP marks a gritty evolution—layered beats echoing his journey. Expect more sonic fire from TRIOS in 2025.
