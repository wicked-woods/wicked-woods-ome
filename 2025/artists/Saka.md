‘Saka’ exemplifies a cutting-edge sonic quality that is both familiar, yet unconventional. The experimental beatmaker draws inspiration from an eclectic variety of underground electronic as well as his hometown of Hong Kong, wielding a sound palette that is both carefully intricate yet chaotically destructive; industrial yet organic; oriental yet occidental. By combining broken beat patterns, undulating soundscapes, rippling melodies and grotesque basslines, the burgeoning bass talent has achieved an instantly recognizable sound that is uniquely his own. Saka is carving his very own path through the left-field electronic space, turning heads every step of the way.
