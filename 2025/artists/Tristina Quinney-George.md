Tristina (she/her) is a 28-year-old multidisciplinary artist with roots as rich and vibrant as her creations — a beautiful blend of Indigenous and Caribbean heritage. Based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Tristina is known for her kind heart, thoughtful hands, and a boundless creative spirit. Friends describe her as deeply romantic, endlessly helpful, and the kind of person who somehow always remembers where the scissors are.

Her artistic journey began in 2022 when she contributed to an interactive art installation for Burning Man — an experience that sparked her love for hands-on creative expression. From there, her passion took flight. By 2023, Tristina launched her own line of handmade eyeglass chains crafted from recycled materials — her debut collection sold out almost immediately and became the spark for her growing small business.

In addition to jewelry making, Tristina is a visual artist and regular community volunteer, often blending creativity with sustainability. Her practice centers on giving new life to forgotten or discarded materials, transforming them into pieces that tell stories of resilience, beauty, and rebirth.

This year marks a thrilling new chapter: Tristina is unveiling her very first solo art installation at Wicked Woods Festival — a whimsical, immersive work made almost entirely from reclaimed materials. Her work invites viewers to step into a world where trash becomes treasure, and nothing is ever truly lost.

When she’s not in the studio (or hot-gluing something at 2am), Tristina can be found lending her time to local initiatives, sipping hibiscus tea, or getting inspired by nature’s quiet details. Her art is both an offering and a love letter — to her community, her culture, and the power of reinvention.
