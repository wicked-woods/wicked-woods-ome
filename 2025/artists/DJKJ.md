DJKJ
Home grown in the land of the Midnight Sun: Musician, DJ, promoter and long-time electronic music enthusiast, DJKJ hails out of Whitehorse, Yukon; Canada’s true north.  KJ is also one of the original producers of the Paradise Music Festival, an annual music festival that takes place in his home town for the last twenty years.

When not performing, he spends his time living a happy average life; working 9 to 5, paying for overpriced groceries and seeking out the adventures that accompany life north of 60˚. Yet, no matter the circumstance or task at hand, he always has his mind on the music...

Aided by over two decades of DJing, 20 years curating the Paradise Music Festival, and a deep appreciation of the relationships born in raves, DJKJ’s passion resonates through intricate melodies, dirty beats and stompy layers lying deep beneath the surface.

Having spent many years playing at all of the local watering holes and some international, Shambhala in 2023, (alongside local hard-hitters and international acts alike), DJKJ has pioneered the Yukon’s electronic music scene since 2001. 

Throughout holding multiple residencies, DJing special events (including loud, elaborate parties in the woods) and promoting his own shows, DJKJ has had a lot of time evolve, expand and establish his personal sound.

For him, it’s all about bass and that underground feeling...playing from his soul in the hope that you, the listener, will truly find yourself lost in the music - feeding that insatiable need to get down!
