Mindful Moon Sound is the collaborative offering of Kendra and Quinton Armstrong, a husband-and-wife duo based in the Kootenays. Their sound healing journeys blend ancient tools and modern music to create deeply immersive, and transformational experiences. Kendra is a Reiki Master, reflexologist, meditation coach, sound healer, and Traditional Chinese Medicine student who has led over 80 workshops. Her facilitation combines quartz crystal and Tibetan singing bowls, guided breathwork, energy healing, and insights into astrology and manifestation. Quinton brings over 20 years of musical experience, including touring Western Canada and years of professional studio work. He infuses each session with live ambient, psychedelic electric guitar, looping melodic layers that support emotional release and nervous system regulation. Together, they offer an intentional space for healing, reflection, and reconnectionâ€”supporting participants in integrating body, mind, and spirit. Their offerings are inclusive, grounded, and accessible for all levels of experience.
