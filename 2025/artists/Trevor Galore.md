Trevor Galore has had his hand in most of Western Canada's EDM festival and concert scene for the last 20 years. Trevor is a founding partner and member of the legendary Sound Company and Speaker Manufacturer PK Sound, and regular at the Village Stage since the early 2000's. As I always say A decade as the Production Manager for PK Sound has given me the opportunity to play shows all over the world, I feel very blessed Playing melodic Drum and Bass and Bass Music and even dropping a throwback house music set from time to time. Keep an eye out for Trevor Galore in your area. Dance floors will be bumping.
