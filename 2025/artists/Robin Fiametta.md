Robin Fiametta's journey with poi began while living on Maui. Seeing the beauty of fire dancers on Little Beach inspired her to learn the art of poi whilst there. Poi turned out to be her gateway prop and she quickly added double staff, double nunchucks, and fire fans to her repertoire. You never know what she's going to spin or light on fire next! Fiametta enjoys spreading the Joy of Poi and has taught classes regularly in Calgary and events such as Astral Harvest, HoopWest, Calgary Tam Tam's, Freezer Burn, Pyroborea and Camp Carnival: Circus and Flow Arts Festival. You can catch Fiametta performing regularly with aGoGo!
