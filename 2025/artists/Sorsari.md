Alex Jensen aka Sorsari has been producing and DJing for over a decade and has been able to create a foundation for himself within the underground bass music scene.   Releasing on notable labels such as Terrorhythm, ProgRAM, Sable Valley, and VISION, you can expect to hear a blend of styles that range from slow and hypnotizing instrumentals, to faster paced palettes of dubstep, grime, and footwork.  He has had a historical impact within the genre of wave and also proves to be a multi-faceted producer and DJ within the several genres of electronic music with a core focus on modern sound system expression.  Sorsari provokes the deeper emotions we can feel when we listen to music together with encouragement.
