Sivz is an artist born out of relentless hard work and passion for the party. Using catchy lyric writing, intricate percussion, rhythmic vocal chops, and dominant vocals as her ultimate tools for expression, her releases on house imprints like Desert Hearts and Farris Wheel Recordings have received support from industry veterans like Chris Lake, CID, Claptone, and Low Steppa, repetitively landing in Beatport's Top 100 charts, placing in Spotify's editorial playlists, and above all — resonating with her dedicated fan base.

Aside from being an evidently talented producer to watch, Sivz is most known as a calculated selector who constantly draws inspiration trotting the globe as an avid music festival chaser. A connoisseur of all things house, you can trust in her chameleon-like ability to deliver the right vibe for any occasion and leave you in drastically different places from where you started. Her thoughtful selections and strategic set progressions have led her to performing at Canada’s most iconic clubs and festivals including Shambhala and Bass Coast, where she often takes the cake for the most talked-about house set of the weekend without fail.
