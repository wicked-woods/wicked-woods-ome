Ration L burst onto the Canadian electronic scene as a driving force behind Fernie’s 6016 Dance Supply. Blending the deep bass heritage of New Zealand with Australia’s psychedelic techno edge, his sets are a BPM and genre blending showcase of grit, nostalgia, and forward-thinking sound.
His 2023 debut EP, Taipo, presents a hypnotic take on atmospheric jungle, weaving techno’s pulse with breakbeat’s raw energy.
For his Wicked Woods debut, Ration L promises a carefully crafted journey from dystopian ambience to seismic bass pressure.
