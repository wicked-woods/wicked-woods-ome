  From to aerials to exotics, Miss Molly Meow graces stages far and wide with her sumptuous swirling
  Lyra Lover and Certified Rave babe she just finished yet another year air dancing at Shambhala and is stoked to be back here this fall for yet another Wicked Woods.  
This gathering holds a special place within as it was her very first festival booking performing Lyra - opening the gateway to the big time stages that she so captivates.  

Starting with a personal 10 x 10 rig at the back of the Unicorn Lounge dance floor, to today at the professional performance stage we know and love as The Hallow. Each year changing and evolving to fit the expansion, the journey to get here and the evolution of growing with this small sick bush party, to a full blown festival has been nothing short of magic 

  Her uniquely sensuous and deeep slow flow style synchs effortlessly as the beats wax and wane. 
Let her draw you in closer as she opulently ooozes and driiiiippps purrrsonality, spinning the audience spellboundâœ¨
