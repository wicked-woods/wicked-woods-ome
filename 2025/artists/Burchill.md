Burchill has made a name for himself in the Canadian music scene over the last decade through his diverse, energetic sets on some of the biggest stages. In 2023, he made his debut at Shambhala Music Festival in the Fractal Forest and was welcomed back to play the 2024 & 2025 event. He has made stops at other major festivals including Rifflandia, Chasing Summer, Wicked Woods, Badlands, Motion Notion, The Womp, Laketown Shakedown and many more. His focus has shifted into music production where he is fine-tuning his sound with electric dancefloor house bangers.
