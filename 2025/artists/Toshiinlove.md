Toshiinlove is a Calgary based DJ and event curator in the underground music scene with a mission to spread love on the dance floor. Toshi's sound reflects a passion for exploring artists who ignite the soul, delivering an immaculate blend of musical flavors. Her sets are in the wide range of house and bass, weaving together melodic layers, dynamic contrasts, and deep, dirty basslines.


Toshi’s residency In Haus Special has established her as a trusted curator for those craving a rich, more vibrant experience beyond the typical EDM club night. She believes the best parties come from mastering the fundamentals, and exceptional sound and ambiance is a must. Toshi’s events offer more than just a stellar night out - they are PLUR friendly spaces for connection and community, discovering fresh talent, and championing diversity behind the decks.
