With a deep appreciation for the craft of DJing, digging, and sharing music, Mood Change (real name Taylor)  seeks out classic and contemporary sounds across genres with a focus on the deep, lush and emotive. As the host of Super Best on Subtle Radio, Taylor looks to present unfamiliar and experimental dance music and elevate his peers, his source of inspiration. 

A longtime contributor to the Canadian west coast scene, Taylorâ€™s past efforts have included organizing and promoting local events, curating Versions, a long-running patio party in Calgary and starting the celebrated mix series Excursions.fm. Taylor has been support for acts such as Lone, Leon Vynehall and Mall Grab, and has performed at festivals like Bass Coast, Shambhala, Rifflandia, and Sled Island.
