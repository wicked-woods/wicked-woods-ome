Young Dene is a Dene selector and electronic music producer based in Vancouver, BC specializing in bass music with a preference for turbo dance floor heaters. While mostly focused on Footwork Jungle and Drum & Bass, Young Dene's musical range extends to Dubstep, Garage, Breaks, Electro, House, Club and more, reflecting a deep-seated love for diverse sonic landscapes that keep the party popping. 

Music has always been a profound influence in Young Dene’s life, with a passion for electronic music ignited by a transformative experience at Shambhala in 2008. In a full circle moment, Young Dene featured in The Village Stage’s iconic Jungle Rinseout party at Shambhala in July 2024, sixteen years later.

Since that transcendental first festival experience, Young Dene has been a dedicated advocate for sound system culture in western and northern Canada, bridging communities of Indigenous and non-Indigenous artists to wider audiences as a consumer, performer, and talent buyer. With six appearances at Bass Coast under their belt, Young Dene now spearheads Low Pass Music, a forward-thinking record label dedicated to developing and promoting Indigenous and West Coast bass music on a global scale.
