Maculate is a San Francisco-Based Award-Winning Video DJ and Music Video Creator. Winner of Twitch TV's 2023 Video DJ of the Year and Global Funk Fam's 2021 Artist of the Year, Maculate's performances blend the vintage and the contemporary, inviting classic sights and sounds from the past into a modern bass-filled future.

He has performed at some of the biggest stages across the world including Shambhala Music Festival, Opulent Temple at Burning Man, MOMs Ball at Mardis Gras, Father Funk's Church of Love at Shindig Music Festival in the UK, and MIDI Festival in Shanghai. In the last year, he has shared the stage with Cut Chemist, A. Skillz (4 times), Fort Knox Five (3 times) and many others. His sets are electric and eclectic -- anything funky with a lot of bass, taking the dance floor on a journey through Bass Funk, Hip Hop, Soul, Breaks, House and DNB.
