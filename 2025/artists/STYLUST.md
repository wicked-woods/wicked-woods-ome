A longtime skateboarder and hip hop devotee, Geoff “Stylust” Reich has always been a rebel with a passion for his art form. It’s no surprise that this Canadian DJ/producer’s talent for fusing hip hop flavor and relentless energy with heavy bass has earned him a reputation as a creative renegade carving his own path.

Stylust’s uncanny ability to blend multiple influences and genres has led to music that’s reached millions of listeners. His collaborations include artists such as Ganja White Night, Of The Trees, Truth, and Buku, with releases on respected labels like Deadbeats, Deep Dark & Dangerous, Subcarbon, and Bassrush.

Geoff’s keen sense for eclectic yet cohesive beats also translates to the stage. Known for delivering dynamic, stand-out sets, he’s toured across the United States, Canada, and Europe, with appearances at major festivals such as Coachella, Shambhala, Outlook, Lightning in a Bottle (LIB), and Envision.

With a bass-heavy yet timeless sound, Stylust electrifies both the dancefloor and headphones with his impeccable taste and rebellious energy.
