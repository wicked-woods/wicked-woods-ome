Daniel Zuccarello is a professional bartender, a serial entrepreneur, and a spoken-word artist with a taste for the raw and the real. He made his poetry debut last year at Wicked Woods Music Festival, delivering verses that stirred the crowd like a perfect cocktail—bold, unexpected, and unforgettable.

By day, Daniel builds businesses and mixes drinks with surgical precision. By night, he crafts poems that cut deeper—exploring identity, loss, ambition, and the strange beauty of being alive in a burning world. His words pour out with the same fire he brings to every bar and boardroom: no filler, no filter, all heart.

With roots in hospitality and vision in every venture, Daniel’s poetry blends street wisdom with lyrical edge. He’s here to stir your spirit, spike your subconscious, and leave you chasing the aftertaste.
