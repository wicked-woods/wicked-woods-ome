A sonic alchemist, Murge weaves the eclectic and the electric to create dancefloor-centric beats that fill the space and lift the crowd. Unorthodox sounds intertwine to create an expansive aural journey filled with fresh, earthy bass and neoteric instrumentals.  Signed to Emancipator’s label Loci Records in 2020, Murge has had a rapid rise, winning accolades from peers and listeners alike and landing features on the biggest DSP editorial playlists. Collaborations with Emancipator, Parra for Cuva, Tor and Frameworks followed, along with support from heavyweights such as BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 6 and Sirius XM.   No stranger to packed dance floors or epic stages, Murge has entranced crowds at some of North America’s most well respected electronic festivals, including BC’s own Bass Coast and Shambhala, and has toured extensively throughout the US. 2024 sees the release of his second album 'Gold & Bliss', a sublime collection of atmospheric new tracks designed to excite and elevate.
