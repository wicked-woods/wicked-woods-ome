Surrey-based Asad Khan (formerly Khanvict) is an escape artist. His cinematic production style, which has led to over 10 million streams online, transports the listener to the desert expanses and jungle paradises from which he borrows inspiration. Khanvict deftly manages to stay close to his Pakistani roots, while drawing  from artists like Clozee and Rüfüs du Sol to create a contemporary low-end homage to his homeland. 

Khan’s ‘Closer’ received the Prism Prize, Canada’s top music video award. The politically charged song has racked up almost 5 Million plays on YouTube, seen him gain over 75K subscribers on the platform, and garnered global press from Rolling Stone to Times of India to The Hindu. The short film supporting the song was a collaboration involving filmmaker Anjali Nayar, model / activist Seema Hari and a hauntingly beautiful exploration of issues of colorism, casteism and misogyny in South Asian culture. That song, and Khanvict’s recent remix of AR Rahman’s ‘Tere Bina’, were both featured in the recent hit Disney show ‘Ms Marvel’. 

Coming up in the South Asian community of Surrey, BC, Khan’s heart has always been in the live experience. His recent Arrival EP and tour with NYC-based violinist Raaginder was a visionary experience combining custom visuals, live instrumentation and live electronica. This show, symbolizing  the coming of age of an entire community, toured across North America before culminating in a sold out performance at the 1,200 capacity Commodore in Vancouver, where the artists continued to break boundaries by becoming the first South Asian, Pakistani, and Sikh artists to sell out the iconic room. 2025 brings a new era  of live musicianship to Khan’s show, melding his training in Indian Classical Music with custom live electronics and featured guests.

Upcoming plans include a halftime concert at the 50,000 capacity BC Place Stadium, new singles every month, and the design of an immersive sound experience called Samah that debuts in early 2026.
