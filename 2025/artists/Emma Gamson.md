I am a multi-media artist who experiments in paint and sculpture. Originally from New Zealand, and currently building a new home in Revelstoke, I have spent the majority of my life embedded in the mountains and nature. I love using my artwork to explore natural patterns and connections between humans and nature.

My current line of work takes inspiration from topographical maps to explore the connection to the physical body and large flowing geometrical shapes. I enjoy exploring the connections between human creations and nature, and the bonds between human beings. 

The Dancer is a concept seeking to bring to life my previous paintings from the Chorographia project. It is a celebration of how nature can be mapped on the human body, and how our body is connected to our natural landscapes. The colours and shapes will follow the flow and patterns of the muscles and shape of the body to add dimension and movement.
