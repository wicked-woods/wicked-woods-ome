Substance is a dubstep producer based in Sherbrooke, QC, Canada. His journey began in
2011 after discovering PK Sound and the vibrant West Coast Canadian rave scene. By
2012, he started promoting events with friends under the DirtyCake brand, bringing
major dubstep acts like Truth, Goth Trad, and Hatcha to his hometown. These efforts
helped build a dedicated bass music community and provided platforms for rising
artists like Wraz.

After a decade of promoting shows and working at festivals across Canada, Substance
shifted focus to his own productions. He quickly gained recognition, earning releases
on renowned labels such as Sentry Records, Deep Dark & Dangerous, Wheel & Deal, and
Nomine Sound. Expanding his repertoire, Substance has also dropped tracks on Boogie
T’s Drama Club Recording and has forthcoming releases on J:Kenzo’s Artikal Records.
Collaborations with artists like Antennae and Abstrakt Sonance further showcase his
range and ability to cross genres within bass music.

In addition to producing, Substance co-hosts Gunfingaz Thursday with Wraz, a popular
Twitch stream that has become a go-to platform for highlighting emerging DJs and
producers in the North American dubstep scene.

His live performances have graced some of the continent’s top festivals, including
Shambhala Music Festival, Bass Coast, Infrasound, and Lightning in a Bottle. These
appearances, combined with consistent releases and community involvement, cement
his reputation as a dynamic force in bass music.

With an exciting 2025 on the horizon, Substance continues to push boundaries, blending
styles and elevating the global dubstep scene.
