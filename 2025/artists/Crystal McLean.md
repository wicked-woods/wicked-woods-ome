Crystal is a fun-loving yogi by day and a raccoonish scamp by night. They  hail from the Okanagan and love spending time in nature with friends. They are most in their element when they are co-creating unique experiences both on the dance floor and off! They love to connect with people authentically  and to help others  foster authentic  connections through movement, mindfulness and creativity. Kundalini Yoga  is their favorite practice because it is so uplifting. Crystal believes we are all at our best when our walls are down and inner children are up and ready to play!
