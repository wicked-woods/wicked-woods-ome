Spānda is an energetic and passionate force behind the decks, bringing an unstoppable energy that keeps dance floors moving. Hailing from Northern California, Spānda is known for crafting inspiring sets that blend breakbeats, breakhop, drum & bass, Afro rhythms, and beyond—always igniting the crowd with her infectious spirit.

With an ear for the unexpected and a deep love for old school rhythms, rhymes and bass-grooves, Spānda aims to deliver a sonic journey that hits hard and lifts spirits. Whether it's the rolling funk of breakbeats, the deep pulse of DnB, or the infectious bounce of Afro-infused beats, her sets are designed for pure movement. As a DJ/Producer Spānda takes inspiration and has shared the stage with many mentors and friends such as Krafty Kuts, A. Skillz. The Gaff, Deekline, Stickybuds and many more. 

Spānda is a Sankrit word meaning pulse, vibration and the connection of energy amongst everything and between everyone.
