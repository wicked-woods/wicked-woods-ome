Long Gone Lonesomes are Hylo Graves and Buddy Wackett. Hailing from Parson B.C., LGLS create dreary soundscapes and mournful lyrics that cut to the bone with raw emotion drawing on influences like pulp horror, cryptids, cosmic chaos, dusty dirt roads, and many other unsettling themes. 
LGLS have released 3 full length albums, and an EP over the last four years on Buddy's own Shady Groove Recordings imprint, receiving favourable reviews in Rolling Stone Germany, Country Music People UK, and charting locally on the Canadian radio earshot! charts.
Come and see for yourself the strange brand of weird country that has no business being as good as it is.
