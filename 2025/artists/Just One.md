Hailing from Nanaimo, BC, 
Just One crafts immersive sets deeply inspired by the raw, driving energy of UK grime and the laid-back, smooth grooves of West Coast hip-hop. As a co-founder of the Renegade Sound Collective, he's become a staple at the Wicked Woods Music Festival's Portal Stage, where he delivers meticulously curated journeys through cutting-edge bass music. His sets are more than just a mix; they're a carefully constructed sonic experience, punctuated with sharp, precise hip-hop scratches that pay homage to his roots. Just One's dedication to pushing the boundaries of bass music, while honoring the sounds that shaped him, creates a truly dynamic and engaging performance.
