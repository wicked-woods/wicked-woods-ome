Lola Phyne doesn’t follow trends—she builds energy from the underground up. Born and raised in Vancouver’s rave scene, she started spinning vinyl as a teen, cutting her chops on drum and bass and dubstep in sweat-soaked basements and after-hours dens. Over time, her sound morphed into a fierce blend of tech and bass house, but the heartbeat stayed the same: heavy, low-end pressure. No matter the genre, Lola’s sets are raw, bass-driven, and built to move bodies. She doesn’t just play tracks—she commands dancefloors.
