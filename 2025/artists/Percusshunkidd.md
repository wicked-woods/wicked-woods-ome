Percusshunkidd, the Ontario Born, West Coast-based rising force in the electronic music scene is making waves with her dynamic presence and unmistakable sound.
Originally stepping into the industry as a promoter, she quickly transitioned behind the decks, where her signature blend of driving Tech House, relentless basslines, and infectious vocals has captured dance floors across British Columbia and Ontario.
Her growing list of high-profile performances includes Victoria Pride Festival in the Park 2023, Kamloops Pride Festival in the Park 2025, Electric Love Music Festival (2024 & 2025), and the highly anticipated Wicked Woods Music Festival this year. Percusshunkidd has shared the stage with heavyweights like Return of the Jaded, Average Citizens, Freddy J, Ben Fox, Sivz, and many more.
With production work underway and fresh surprises planned for her live sets, Percusshunkidd is just getting started.
