Bonzai (they/them) is a DJ/producer based in amiskwaciy-wâskahikan (otherwise known as Edmonton, Alberta). With a focus on extended blends and home grown mashups, they pull heavy influence from trap, dubstep, hip hop and experimental subgenres to give listeners that underground sound they've been looking for. As a member of the trans and queer community, they strive to use their platform to bring visibility and voice to marginalized groups within the music scene.

On the other side of the bins, Kai can be found dedicating their time to the theatre and arts communities as a stage carpenter and scenic fabricator. They are growing their roots alongside festival and event collectives within these roles and are excited to contribute back to their community through these creative ventures.

Notable music accomplishments include performances at Electric Sky (SK) and Neon Jungle (AB)  as well as opening for headliners DE-TÜ, Sundog and Taiki Nulight. Their mixes have been featured on CJSW, sub.fm and AAJA radio shows.
