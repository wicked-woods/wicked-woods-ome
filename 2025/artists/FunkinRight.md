FunkinRight is all about fun and funky party music, and having a good time.

This Canadian funk slangin producer has released over 23 tracks since 2019, with support from labels like Breakbeat Paradise, Render Recordings, Twists of Time, Wildfire Recordings, and B Nasty Beats. His genre jumping DJ style paved the way for multi-genre production, where he continues to push the limits and make beats outside the box.

FunkinRight’s musical CV is as long as it is funky, and he’s shared the stage many of his own inspirations including Askillz, Featurecast, Father Funk, JFB, Megan Hamilton, Phibes, Pineo & Loeb, The Sponges, WBBL, X-Ray Ted, and more. FunkinRight has also been blessed with funky sets at many amazing events including Burn in the Forest, Curiosity, FozzyFest, Freezerburn, Restart, Wicked Woods, Vibrant, and many more.

It’s about living right, loving right, and treating people right. It’s about doing what you love, with the people you love to do it with, and always (always) staying funky.
