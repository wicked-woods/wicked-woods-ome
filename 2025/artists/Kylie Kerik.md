Kylie is multi-passionate facilitator and professional. She's spent the last decade weaving together the threads of self-expression, embodiment, and intentional living. With a background in environmental engineering, event coordination, and festival operations, she's led a wide range of initiatives—from sustainability workshops to somatic-style sessions grounded in personal growth and transformation.
My current work is rooted in enclothed cognition—the science of how what we wear impacts how we feel and show up in the world. Through her workshops and counselling practice, she guides people to reconnect with their bodies, and authenticity, through modalities like clothing, somatic awareness, and play.
I believe that when people feel safe in their bodies (and in their clothes), they show up more powerfully, more joyfully—and that’s the kind of energy I love contributing to festival culture.
