Bright and bold… in art AND personality… he wouldn’t have it any other way. Schwoopin’ in from the depths of Edmonton’s tattoo scene, he thought what better way to end the summer than to leave a bit of his cartoonish personality at @WickedWoodsMusicFestival than by bustin’ out a piece of art for all to enjoy during their adventures through the day… but, more importantly to feast their eyes upon through the night. His only hope is his art will bring a smirk to the faces of those that pass by on their way to see their favourite producers. You’ll find him spending most of his time at the Portal, but his ear will take him to anywhere with that heavy dark dub and BASS! Go take a gander and smash that follow button @JamesGreenawayTattoo if you wanna see what else he gets up to on the daily back home. And… don’t be afraid to say “Hey!” if you see him at work or wanderin’ about… he’s got a special sticker of his boy URL:// he will be handing out to those that ask. Let’s play safe… and make new memories for us to look back on for years to come.
