Felix Cartal is a prolific producer and DJ that hails from Vancouver, Canada. His style is energetic and melodic, and his shows match. His
resume is vast, including collabs with Kaskade, Elohim, and Daya, as well as remixes for The Chainsmokers, Selena Gomez, Zedd, Illenium,
and nimino’s latest “I Only Smoke When I Drink”... to name a few.

Felix has racked up a string of hits, and won 2 JUNO Awards for Best
Dance Recording (2020’s “Love Me” and 2024’s “Need Your Love”). In 2024 he released his latest anthems, Feel Less (with Lights) and Right
On Time (with the iconic Tegan and Sara). He also continued his legendary pop up parties, culminating with a 5000 person beach party
in Vancouver and the first ever rave at the top of the CN tower in Toronto.

His club ready house tracks are cherished by fans across the spectrum of dance music.
