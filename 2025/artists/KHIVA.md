Nurturing a propensity toward the emotionally fueled and often dramatic, bass driven styles offer a natural focal point, but in no way a limit, for Khiva's musical exports. Low frequency soundscapes, fierce beats and a contrasting ethereal nature provide a blueprint for her works, setting the stage for the multifaceted producer and vocalist to paint a vivid dreamscape through often haunting and metaphorical lyrical stylings.

Seeing a rapidly expanding tour schedule since the release of her debut EP in 2018, Khiva has continued to bend notions of what electronic music is and can be while proving she herself is unboxable, and make powerful impressions at some of bass musicâ€™s top events across the map, delivering standout sets everywhere she goes. Generating undeniably impactful waves with her original productions and compelling performances, including debuting her live vocal performance in the end of 2019, her one of a kind sound continues to evolve and mark Khiva as a force to be reckoned with.
