Vancouver’s queer femme bass supergroup, composed of DJ BEER, LOUP, and Steph Tsunami, LVL (elle-vee-elle) is known for their dynamic sets featuring a range of high-energy sounds and catchy vocal stabs that electrify the crowd. Flexing an expansive collection from breaks & 140 to techno, jungle, and drum & bass, this high-octane trio keeps the dancefloor flowing with their fun and fast sound. 

They have played some of BC’s largest venues such as Red Room, Celebrities, and Capital Ballroom supporting artists like Andy C, Sam Binga, Gentlemen’s Club, Canabliss, Delta Heavy, the WORSHIP tour (Sub Focus, Dimension, Culture Shock, 1991) and more. Collectively, the members of LVL have toured across BC playing events and festivals including Bass Coast, Fvded in the Park, Contact, Rifflandia, Wicked Woods, ValhallaFest, and many more. 

Buckle up, it’s time to go faster.
