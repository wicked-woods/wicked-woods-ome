Born and raised amidst the towering redwoods of Kings Mountain, California, and now thriving in Denver, Colorado, CØNTRA crafts a sound deeply rooted in nature and influenced by a life of exploration. With over a decade immersed in Denver’s vibrant bass music culture—one of the richest in the United States—Ezra Arenson (CØNTRA) has honed an organic style that bridges deep dubstep and world bass, that hits hard and resonates deeper, reflecting the sonic diversity of his journey.

CØNTRA’s evolving catalog features releases on prestigious labels such as Deep Dark & Dangerous, DUPLOC, Wheel & Deal, Odyzey, Gravitas, and Street Ritual. Drawing comparisons to artists like The Widdler and Pushloop, CØNTRA’s music merges deep, powerful bass with global influences. His tracks are marked by dark, spacious soundscapes that build tension, blending hypnotic low-end frequencies with subtle melodic elements. This unique fusion creates a raw, immersive experience, drawing from the atmospheric depth of dubstep and the intricate design of world bass.

CØNTRA’s dynamic performances have graced some of the most renowned venues and festivals across the country. Most notably festivals like Lightning in a Bottle and The Untz, with standout performances at venues like Meow Wolf and the iconic Cervantes in Denver, his shows leave a lasting impact every time.
