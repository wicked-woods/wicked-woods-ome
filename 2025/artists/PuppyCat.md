PuppyCat is the sonic amalgamation of Howl and MisfortuneCat. Known for their deep heavy style, setting a relentless 140 bpm pulse reverberating beyond the physical. Their surgical chaos of double-dropped tracks and overlapping beats coalesce into a single resonant frequency, one that seems to vibrate beyond the speakers, changing the very air itself. 

Since 2020 PuppyCat has been commandeering sound systems and transforming dancefloors into an interdimensional incident at festivals like Shambhala, Wicked Woods, Altitude, Heartburn and Neon Jungle. They’re crawling out of hibernation and ready to unleash heck this summer with a stockpile of Dubstep, Grime, UKG, 140 and anything bass heavy that catches their ears. 

Bring your gunfingers they’ll provide the ammo.
