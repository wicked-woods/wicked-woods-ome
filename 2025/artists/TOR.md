Tor is a JUNO Award winning music producer and DJ who has been releasing original music since 2011. Oasis Sky is Tor’s first original body of work since his 2016 album, Blue Book. It expands on the latter’s meditative energy with the producer’s signature warmth and beat-driven atmospherics, while digging deeper into the
experiences and emotions that have informed the past 4 years of his life. From a busy touring schedule that saw the Vancouver-based producer playing his music across the U.S., the E.U., Australia, and Costa Rica, as well as being
sought out to produce remixes for Max Cooper, Fejká, Frameworks, and RÜFÜS DU SOL, the album only began to come into focus after slowing down, establishing roots, finding centre and introspection in a new living space. Since Oasis Sky's release it has gone on to accumulate over 26 million streams across platforms, been played on BBC Radio 1, Sirius XM Chill, and NPR, featured on CSI: Vegas, and won Electronic Album of the Year at the 2022 JUNO Awards.
