KristalKrom is a multidimensional DJ/Vocalist duo channeling atmospheric bass, spiritual rhythm, and otherworldly emotion into a unified sonic experience.
Made up of Kristal Jem — the voice, the priestess of vibration — and Joey Krom — the sonic seamstress stitching together ethereal textures and deep low-end grooves — their sets evoke a journey that’s both grounded and galactic.

Expect half-time swells, haunting melodies, sacred basslines, and a touch of the spooky. It’s not just music — it’s a transmission from the edge of dreamspace.
Prepare to be wrapped in sound, cracked open by resonance, and carried gently into the void.
