Hailing from Atlanta, Georgia, Nicole Gracia Barton, better known as Zen Selekta, crafts music that masterfully merges haunting, profound, and shadowy elements with ethereal melodies and global influences. Her creative flame is kindled by the diverse tapestry of life itself â€” be it through her rich Spanish heritage, books, films, spiritual practices such as meditation, exploration in nature, and engaging dialogues with those she meets along her path. She finds magic in the wonders of our diverse world and the cultures that intertwine within it, weaving these influences into her music.

Nicole's musical odyssey transcends the realm of rhythm to touch on a broader mission. Under the moniker Zen Selekta, her ultimate goal is to create experiences that enrich lives, bringing joy, healing, and solace to many through her music.
