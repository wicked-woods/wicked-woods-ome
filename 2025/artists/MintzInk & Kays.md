In the heart of LeyLine Studio, Kays and MintzInk weave calligraffiti, geometry, and organic flow into living worlds of color and form. Their work is where letters dance, patterns breathe, and murals hum with the energy of both structure and chaos.

By day, they etch their visions into skin, creating tattoos that carry stories. By night, they step into other realms—murals, canvases, and mixed-media experiments—transforming blank space into something enchanted.

Rooted in Saskatchewan soil and pulsing with the rhythms of the electronic music scene, their friendship is both muse and mirror—sparking ideas, daring experiments, and art that feels like it couldn’t have come from anywhere else.
