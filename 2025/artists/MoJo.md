Originally from Calgary, but now based out of Vernon, British Columbia. MoJo has had a love for the electronic music scene for many years, and captivates her exposure to deep bass music culture as her inspiration to production and mixing. With seamless mixing she likes to tell a story with her sets, expelling her love and passion within the scene, making an impact on others with her energy. While mostly being passionate about low-end and experimental bass, she doesn't shy away from pushing boundaries and has opened for artists such as Atyya, Woofax and Burchill. Don't be fooled by her small and innocent outward form, as she is known to throw down the nastiest of beats.
