Peta Thompson is an E-RYT 500 Yoga Teacher Trainer, Somatic Therapy Practitioner, and former competitive skydiver who learned to move in sync with others while freefalling through the sky. Based in Nelson, BC, she brings over a decade of experience facilitating embodiment through the lens of nervous system education, subtle energy, and breath. Peta teaches immersive trainings on pranayama, somatic practices, and subtle anatomy, weaving together depth and play in every space she holds. Her trauma-informed approach invites people to land fully in their bodies, curious, alive, and free.
