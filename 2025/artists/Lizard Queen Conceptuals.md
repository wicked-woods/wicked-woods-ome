I’m The Lizard Queen, a multidisciplinary artist and the Art & Decor Operations Manager for Wicked Woods Music and Arts Festival. My creative journey began in early childhood with a deep love for collage, evolving into a practice rooted in storytelling, sustainability, and immersive visual environments.
Through Lizard Queen Conceptuals, I create mixed-media works that transform recycled materials into textured, surreal compositions. My work explores themes of emotional cartography, transformation, and the hidden beauty in discarded objects. I believe art should spark reflection, invite curiosity, and reclaim what’s been overlooked.
At Wicked Woods, I oversee the full scope of art and decor programming—curating visual experiences, coordinating artists, managing timelines, and ensuring each piece contributes to the festival’s creative landscape. I bring that same sense of vision and leadership to every public art project I take on.
My mission is to create bold, sustainable work that transforms space, challenges perception, and reminds people that art can come from anywhere—especially from what others throw away. You can explore my work at www.lizardqueenconceptuals.com or on Instagram @lizardqueenconcept.
