Hanna SoLow - United Bass Kollective

Hanna SoLow is a multifaceted DJ and event curator from Edmonton, Alberta, who tells a story through her dynamic sets. An aficionado of beats that make the bass bins go “brrrrrrr”, bass music is her bread and butter. From deep dubstep, to UKG, to baile funk, to drum and bass, her sets will keep you guessing and are guaranteed to ignite the dancefloor. 

A longtime contributor to the Canadian music scene, Hanna SoLow has poured her heart into festivals and events throughout Western Canada. As a DJ, she has performed alongside The Librarian, Youngsta, PAV4N, Moody Good, Super Future and ONHELL among others in a few short years. She made her festival debut at Wicked Woods Music Festival in 2024 and just recently played at Downtown Defrost in 2025. This year, she has started to learn how to produce music and is looking forward to continuing to learn, grow and push forward in her musical journey.
