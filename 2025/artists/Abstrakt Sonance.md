Bursting from the rugged wilds of Western Canada, Abstrakt Sonance fuses the primal pulse of nature with gritty urban basslines that are revolutionizing music. Operating from his secluded forest sanctuary, heâ€™s struck sound gold with industry titans like D Double E and Flowdan, Irah and Killa P, while also resurrecting the classic vibes of funk phenoms, Skyler Jett and Ronald LaPread from The Commodores with his diversity of production skills.

With a performance resume spanning the iconic stages of Outlook, Shambhala, and Red Rocks,
Abstrakt Sonance has painted his unique sonic signature across four continents, gathering a
following that is as raw and compelling as his sounds.
