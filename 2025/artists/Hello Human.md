Hello Human is an electronic music producer from Calgary who creates bass-heavy journeys filled with emotion and atmosphere. Their sound blends dubstep, drum and bass, UK garage, halftime, and subtle touches of hip hop and ethereal vocals. The result is a style that feels equal parts gritty and transcendent.

Rooted in rave culture and driven by a love for the raw energy of live shows, Hello Humanâ€™s music invites listeners to feel deeply, lose themselves, and return with something new. Influenced by artists like CharlestheFirst, Eprom, and LSDREAM, their work explores the space between melody and distortion, tension and release.

With a growing presence in the Western Canadian festival scene and a strong focus on original material, Hello Human is shaping a sound that is raw, immersive, and built to stir both heart and mind.
