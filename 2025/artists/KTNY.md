Bouncing with high energy, self-taught Kootenay DJ and music producer KTNY made major moves in 2023 & 2024. His track Greecy held the #1 position on Beatport's Bass House Releases, which earned himself Phunk Junk Records #1 Artist. He played multiple festivals across Western Canada, and finished off 2024 strong with a Western Canada tour including 12 shows in 3 months.

The man behind KTNY, Derek Pettigrew, bought his first DJ controller at 13. While his roots lie in Creston, the move to Fernie and influence from other DJs in the Elk Valley saw his creativity thrive. Driven by an appetite for the stoke, his creative expression craves the atmosphere of electronic music. 

Fragrant with an assortment of House, Bass, and DnB, KTNY prides himself on maintaining an aura of cheekiness, topping off sets with dropping dirty tunes. He feels the rooms vibe and has a finger on the pulse of each beat, attracting bodies to the dance floor at any hour. 

KTNY's core competency is to get the crowd going, and he never fails to deliver. Music is one of the only things on this planet that can switch my mood on a dime, he says. A song can remind me of memories, and it brings me back. It's my safe zone. It's my happy place... House is where my heart lies for sure
