I’ve been a part of the rave community since 1993, where my love for dance first lit a fire in me. In 2016, I joined Lagouge and brought that passion to the stage with a beautiful team of performers. Since then, I’ve been honoured to dance at festivals across Canada and beyond, including Shambhala, Vibrant, Astral Harvest, Fozzy Fest, Crystal Bowl, Paradise, LEMF, WOMP, Wind Down, Friendzy Fest, Bamboo Bass in Costa Rica, and my home festival — Wicked Woods.
When it’s not festival season, you’ll often find me performing with Calgary’s amazing EDM crews, or mentoring the next generation of dancers through one of my local residencies — helping them gain experience and confidence before stepping onto festival stages.
In recent years, I’ve shifted from strictly dancing to stepping into the role of performance arts coordinator, weaving narrative and story into every stage moment. Wicked Woods has become my passion project and my purpose — a place where I create immersive experiences through movement with some of the most talented performers I know.
