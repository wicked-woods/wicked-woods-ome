SID and SmoCo are two absolute forces in the local electronic music scene. 

SID is an indigenous artist from Treaty 7 who has a big appetite for dark, bass-heavy sounds. Over the last four years, she has been dedicated to a constant and loving pursuit of fine tuning her craft. SIDâ€™s journey as an artist has led her to share the stage with renowned artists such as Deathpact, Alix Perez, and Distinct Motive. Dubstep is her specialty but her wide ranging sets play with a variety of genres that naturally draw you to those bone-rattling subs.

SmoCo is a first-generation Indo-Canadian DJ with a deep love for bass music. Growing up in the punk scene while secretly drawn to dubstep, she now blends UK Garage, Breaks, Jungle, Drum & Bass, and Dubstep in her dynamic sets. Her music reflects both personal emotion and her South Asian heritage, bringing diverse sounds to the forefront.

Together, they are excited to grace the Portal Stage for an iconic B2B. They may be small, but their infectious energy and skilled sound selections are sure to captivate all within earshot. These two high vibe artists play only the best low-end, sub-thumping beats. Their art is not only a reflection of their diverse backgrounds, but a testament to their unwavering dedication to keeping it cvnty.
