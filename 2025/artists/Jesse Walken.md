Jesse is a hobby artist who left Ontario when covid began to plant trees in BC. Once she got a taste of the great wild west she knew that is where she needed to be, with great community and incredible views. Now based in Prince George she sells and delivers craft beer to all 4 corners of Northern BC and makes art in her free time. Having received her Visual and Creative arts diploma she knows how to work with a variety of mediums, knitted textiles, and watercolor painting being her favorites; and with intentions to pick up stained glass and leather working in the future! She believes art should always be accessible to everyone and that we must keep teaching people so its kept alive in both classic and evolving techniques.
