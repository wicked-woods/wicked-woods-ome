Having been born the UK and grown up in the Sea to Sky, Calamity (Callum Clarke) has been heavily influenced and inspired by Dubstep scenes all around the world, mixing 140 bass across it's true spectrum from dancehall and dub to grime, drill and dubstep. A relatively fresh face on the scene, Calamity brings in a refreshing sound that stays true to the origins of dubstep, whilst at the same time keeping an open ear to new genre bending sounds. Although Cal only played his first live set in May 2024, he has gained precious experience gritting his teeth into opening sets for Hypho, Youngsta and Abstrakt Sonnance in the Sea to Sky. Off the decks Cal is a part of the Sea to Sound Collective crew, focusing on pushing 140 and bass music back home in Whistler and Squamish.
