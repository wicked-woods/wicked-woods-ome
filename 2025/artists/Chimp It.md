Blending the richness of cutting edge electronic music with the depth and emotion of blistering guitar licks and live vocals

Chimp It’s signature move is to keep their fans guessing, as they weave their original material into edits and remixes from their favourite artists and peers, moving through Garage, Dubstep, House, DnB or whatever fresh gems they’ve uncovered in the far reaches of the music-verse.

They have been selected for prime time slots at events such as Shambhala, Wicked Woods, Friendzy Fest, Tiny Lights and Arc’teryx Academy. Chimp It has been invited to open and perform live with acts such as Moontricks, Lazy Syrup Orchestra, Pineo & Loeb and Kytami & Phonik Ops.
