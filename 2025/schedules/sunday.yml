Quinton will complement the experience with soothing, psychedelic electric guitar riffs, adding a layer of musical healing through the use of various guitar pedals.The soothing tones of the crystal and Tibetan singing bowls, each tuned to a specific chakra, will help align participants' physical and energetic bodies. This sound journey will guide them into a deep meditative state, facilitating the release of what no longer serves them. As the healing vibrations resonate throughout the body, participants will experience a profound recalibration at a cellular level, resetting the nervous system, calming the mind, and offering a sense of true rest.Participants will be invited to lie down in a peaceful, comfortable environment, allowing them to fully receive the benefits of the sound bath. The workshop will leave them feeling balanced, relaxed, and reconnected to their highest self.Please bring a yoga mat or blanket to lay down on and any other props you’d like to feel cozy (blanket, pillow, crystals)."
