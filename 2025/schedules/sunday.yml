      Join husband-and-wife duo Quinton and Kendra Armstrong for a deeply transformative and immersive live sound healing experience designed to bring participants into a state of deep relaxation, rejuvenation, and self-discovery.
      
      In this workshop, Kendra will guide participants through breathwork while playing quartz crystal and Tibetan singing bowls. Quinton will complement the experience with soothing, psychedelic electric guitar riffs, adding a layer of musical healing through the use of various guitar pedals.
      
      The soothing tones of the crystal and Tibetan singing bowls, each tuned to a specific chakra, will help align participants' physical and energetic bodies. This sound journey will guide them into a deep meditative state, facilitating the release of what no longer serves them. As the healing vibrations resonate throughout the body, participants will experience a profound recalibration at a cellular level, resetting the nervous system, calming the mind, and offering a sense of true rest.
      
      Participants will be invited to lie down in a peaceful, comfortable environment, allowing them to fully receive the benefits of the sound bath. The workshop will leave them feeling balanced, relaxed, and reconnected to their highest self.Please bring a yoga mat or blanket to lay down on and any other props you’d like to feel cozy (blanket, pillow, crystals).

      The Wicked Woods Poetry Slam is a one-of-a-kind, open-air spoken word event that merges poetry, storytelling, and performance art into an immersive festival experience. Hosted in a vibrant outdoor setting, this event invites festival-goers to witness and participate in a dynamic celebration of words, rhythm, and raw emotion.

      As the host, I will begin by setting the tone with a curated selection of spoken word performances, creating an inviting and inspiring atmosphere. As the energy builds, audience members will be encouraged to step up and share their own poetry, transforming the event into a spontaneous and interactive exchange of voices, perspectives, and emotions. Whether you're a seasoned poet or simply someone who loves the beauty of language, this is a space for you to engage, express, and connect.
