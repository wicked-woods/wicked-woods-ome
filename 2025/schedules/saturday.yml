      Get grounded before you get down. 
      
      This pre-rave warm-up is a guided movement and breath journey designed to prime your body and nervous system for the dancefloor. We’ll stretch open the hips, hamstrings, spine, and shoulders, shake off tension, activate energy channels, and land deeply in the body—so you can dance from a place of freedom, flow, and full-body yes.
      
      We'll blend functional mobility, somatic unwinding, gentle self-massage, breath regulation, and grounding techniques to help participants:
        Release tightness from travel, camping, or previous nights dancing
        Reconnect to their body and breath before stimulation
        Regulate the nervous system (especially for those with social or sensory sensitivity)
        Increase mobility and stamina for dancingCultivate presence, joy, and body awareness
        
      All bodies and experience levels are welcome. No previous movement or yoga experience is needed. Just bring a mat or towel, water, and a curiosity for what it means to move with your body, not against it.
      
      This is the ultimate act of self-care before you set your soul loose on the dancefloor. 
      
      Come get loose, get embodied, and get ready to rave with heart.
