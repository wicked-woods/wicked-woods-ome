      Somatic Steez is an interactive workshop designed to help participants uncover their authentic style—or “steez”—through the lens of somatics and self-expression. Rooted in the science of enclothed cognition, this experience invites people to explore how different textures, colors, and styles impact their internal state.
      
      Participants will engage in somatic practices to connect with their body’s subtle cues—those intuitive nudges that say, “Yes, this feels authentic.” The workshop encourages play and experimentation, inviting people to try on new styles and sensations while tuning into how their soma (body) responds.

  - title: Knit a Stitch
    artist: Jesse Walken
    time: 2:00 PM
    endTime: 3:00 PM
    description: |
      In this workshop, I will teach attendees how to make a small knitted bookmark (it could also be turned into a bracelet).
      
      I will show them how to cast onto the knitting needle and then how to do a basic knit stitch, and repeat until they have a uniform long rectangle. When they have done enough knitting to complete their small project, I will show them how to cast off and have their first own knitted item!
      
      I will be bringing a variety of yarns with different colours, thickness, and textures so people can make a more personal creation and they can have the option to keep the knitting needles to continue this possible newfound passion and hobby! Wool you come and join me?
