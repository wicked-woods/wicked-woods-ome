It’s almost time to adventure into the Woods! ✨🌲 Before you roll through the gates, here’s what you need to know ⬇️

🎟️ Tickets: Claim them in the Portal before you arrive. Got extras in your name? Transfer them to your crew ahead of time.

🚗 Finding us: Look for the black iron gates + Raven’s Nest sign. That’s the only official entrance (don’t get tricked by the wrong driveway 👀).

🕙 Gate hours matter: No vehicle driving on site after 10 PM. Arriving late? You can still check in + walk your gear to camp, then bring your car in at 8 AM when the campground roads reopen.

⏱️ Highway gate closed 2 AM - 7 AM. No arrivals during this time (security on site for emergencies only).

💳 Payments at Gate: Debit / Credit / Cash all accepted! Cards are quicker for everyone, but the choice is always yours.

💚 Plan ahead, travel safe, and get ready to step into the magic of Wicked Woods. We can’t wait to see you under the stars. 🌌
